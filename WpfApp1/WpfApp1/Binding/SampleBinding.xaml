    <!-- Binding is basically establishing a connection betweeen two different Controls so that 
    we can control the properties of one control using the properties of other control
    But this can be done in two Ways : 1) Writing C# logic 2) Using Binding without writing any C# code-->
    
    <!-- Binding has 3 main Parts : 1) Binding SOURCE 2) Binding TARGET 3) Binding OBJECT
    SOURCE : It is the Control from which we want to read the Data and the VALUE from it
    (eg Slider and Textbox, as we move the Slider , txtbox width shud Increase, so in this case,
    we have to read the Value from the SLIDER, so SLIDER BECOMES THE SOURCE)
    
    TARGET - Control whose VALUE we want to change BASED on the VALUE changed in the SOURCE
    OBJECT - To Control the BINDING PROCESS btw the Source and Target
    
    3 TYPES
    1) One Way - To CHANGE the Value of the TARGET based on the Changes in the SOURCE
    2) Two Way - Bidirectional, if Target Value is changed, those changes will be REFLECTED in SOURCE
    and Vice-Versa
    3) One Way to Source - Exact Opposite of One Way (This is from Target to SOurce)
    4) One Time - -->
